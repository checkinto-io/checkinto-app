# Release Design Document: v0.2.0-core-ui
Technical implementation and design guide for the upcoming release.

## 1. Features Summary
_Overview of features included in this release._

This release builds the complete user interface for the meetup check-in application with three main screens:

- **F005: Welcome Screen** - Event welcome page with title, welcome message, and prominent check-in button
- **F006: Check-in Form** - Four-field form collecting first name, last name, email, and interesting fact with validation
- **F007: Confirmation Screen** - Success page displaying checked-in message and venue information
- **F008: Mobile Responsive Design** - Optimized UI for mobile devices with large, accessible buttons
- **F009: Basic Styling** - Clean, elegant design using Tailwind CSS utility classes

## 2. Technical Architecture Overview
_High-level technical structure that supports all features in this release._

**Frontend Framework:**
- Continue using existing SvelteKit + TypeScript foundation
- Single dynamic route `[eventId]/+page.svelte` handles all three screens via state management
- Component-based architecture with reusable UI elements

**State Management:**
- Local component state to track current screen (welcome → form → confirmation)
- Form state management for attendee data collection
- Error state handling for validation and submission feedback

**Styling Framework:**
- Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling approach
- Mobile-first responsive design principles
- Large button targets (minimum 44px) for touch accessibility
- Clean, minimal aesthetic with good contrast ratios

**Screen Flow Logic:**
```
Welcome Screen → Check-in Form → Confirmation Screen
     ↓                ↓                ↓
Display Event     Collect & validate   Show Event
Title & Welcome   attendee data        Checked In Message
Message from DB   (save to Attendees   from DB
                  & Event_Attendees)
```

**Data Sources:**
- **Welcome Screen**: Event.Title and Event.Welcome_Message from database
- **Check-in Form**: Collects data for Attendees table (first_name, last_name, email, interesting_fact)
- **Confirmation Screen**: Event.Checked_In_Message from database
- **Database Operations**: Insert/Update Attendees table, create Event_Attendees relationship

## 3. Implementation Notes
_Shared technical considerations across all features in this release._

**Component Structure:**
```
src/routes/[eventId]/+page.svelte (main container)
├── WelcomeScreen.svelte
├── CheckinForm.svelte
├── ConfirmationScreen.svelte
└── components/
    ├── Button.svelte
    ├── Input.svelte
    └── TextArea.svelte
```

**Form Validation Strategy:**
- Client-side validation for immediate feedback
- Required field validation for all inputs
- Email format validation using regex pattern
- Character limit enforcement (255 chars) for interesting fact
- Visual error indicators with helpful error messages

**Mobile-First Design Principles:**
- Viewport meta tag for proper mobile scaling
- Touch-friendly button sizes (minimum 44px tap targets)
- Large, readable fonts (minimum 16px to prevent zoom)
- Generous spacing between interactive elements
- Single-column layout optimized for portrait orientation

**State Management Pattern:**
- Use writable stores for form data persistence during session
- Screen navigation controlled by reactive variables
- Clean state reset when moving between different events

## 4. Other Technical Considerations
_Shared any other technical information that might be relevant to building this release._

**Accessibility Requirements:**
- Semantic HTML structure with proper headings
- Form labels properly associated with inputs
- Focus management for keyboard navigation
- ARIA labels for screen readers
- High contrast ratios for text readability

**Performance Considerations:**
- Lazy loading for non-critical components
- Minimal bundle size for mobile performance
- Optimize images and assets for quick loading
- Efficient re-rendering with Svelte's reactivity

**Browser Compatibility:**
- Modern mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile, Firefox Mobile)
- Progressive enhancement for older browsers
- CSS fallbacks for unsupported features

**Form UX Best Practices:**
- Auto-focus on first field when form appears
- Real-time validation feedback
- Clear visual hierarchy and flow
- Intuitive error messaging
- Confirmation before submission

## 5. Open Questions
_Unresolved technical or product questions affecting this release._

1. **Button Styling:** Should we use gradient backgrounds, solid colors, or outlined buttons for the primary CTA?

2. **Loading States:** Do we need loading spinners during form submission, or is the transition to confirmation sufficient?

3. **Error Handling:** How should we handle form submission errors that aren't validation-related (network issues, etc.)?

4. **Screen Transitions:** Should there be animated transitions between screens, or simple instant state changes?

5. **Form Persistence:** Should form data persist if user accidentally navigates away, or start fresh each time?

6. **Venue Information:** What specific venue details should be displayed on the confirmation screen (WiFi, bathrooms, schedule)?
