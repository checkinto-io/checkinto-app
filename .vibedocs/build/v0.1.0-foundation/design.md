# Release Design Document: v0.1.0-foundation
Technical implementation and design guide for the upcoming release.

## 1. Features Summary
_Overview of features included in this release._

This foundational release establishes the core development infrastructure and basic architecture for the meetup check-in application:

- **F001: Project Setup** - Initialize SvelteKit project with TypeScript configuration
- **F002: Database Schema** - Create Supabase tables and relationships for Events, Attendees, and Event_Attendees
- **F003: Basic Routing** - Implement dynamic routing for event-specific URLs (`/[eventId]`)
- **F004: Development Environment** - Configure development tools, linting, and formatting standards
- **F005: Git Setup** - Initialize Git repository, connect to GitHub, add README.md and .gitignore

## 2. Technical Architecture Overview
_High-level technical structure that supports all features in this release. May include information about the frontend stack, backend / api, authentication, database, deployment, etc._

**Frontend Framework:**
- SvelteKit with TypeScript for type safety and modern development experience
- Vite as build tool (included with SvelteKit)
- File-based routing with dynamic parameters for event URLs

**Backend & Database:**
- Supabase as Backend-as-a-Service providing PostgreSQL database and RESTful API
- Three-table relational schema:
  - `event` (id, url_id, title, welcome_message, checked_in_message, active)
  - `attendee` (id, first_name, last_name, email, interesting_fact, created_at)
  - `event_attendee` (event_id, attendee_id, created_at)

**Development Tools:**
- ESLint for code quality
- Prettier for consistent formatting
- TypeScript for static type checking

## 3. Implementation Notes
_Shared technical considerations across all features in this release._

**Project Structure:**
```
├── src/
│   ├── routes/
│   │   ├── [eventId]/
│   │   │   └── +page.svelte
│   │   └── +layout.svelte
│   ├── lib/
│   │   ├── database.ts
│   │   └── types.ts
│   └── app.html
├── README.md
├── .gitignore
├── package.json
└── .env (local only)
```

**Environment Configuration:**
- Local `.env` file for Supabase credentials
- Environment variable validation on startup
- Separate development and production configurations

**Database Design Decisions:**
- `url_id` in event table allows friendly URLs separate from primary key
- `email` field in attendee table will serve as natural unique identifier for upserts
- Junction table supports many-to-many relationship for future multi-event attendance

**Routing Implementation:**
- Single dynamic route `[eventId]/+page.svelte` handles ALL events
- Square brackets `[eventId]` create a dynamic parameter that captures any URL segment
- Same template renders different content based on the eventId parameter
- Route will validate event exists and is active via database lookup
- 404 handling for invalid event IDs

## 4. Other Technical Considerations
_Shared any other technical information that might be relevant to building this release._

**Database Security:**
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies to be configured in Supabase
- Public read access for event data, restricted write access
- API key management and environment variable security

**Type Safety:**
- TypeScript interfaces for all database entities
- Strict type checking enabled in tsconfig.json
- Generated types from Supabase schema where possible

**Code Quality Standards:**
- ESLint configuration with Svelte-specific rules
- Prettier configuration for consistent formatting
- Pre-commit hooks for automated code quality checks

**Git Repository Setup:**
- Initialize Git repository and connect to https://github.com/icodewith-ai/meetup-check-in
- Basic README.md with simple app description
- Comprehensive .gitignore for SvelteKit projects (including .env files)
- Initial commit with foundation files

**Performance Considerations:**
- SvelteKit's automatic code splitting
- Minimal initial bundle size for mobile performance
- Database query optimization for event lookups

## 5. Open Questions
_Unresolved technical or product questions affecting this release._

1. **URL_ID Format:** Should event URL IDs be UUIDs, slugs, or sequential numbers? Need to consider collision prevention and user-friendliness.

2. **Database Indexes:** Which fields need indexing for optimal query performance? Particularly for `url_id` lookups and email-based attendee searches.

3. **Error Handling Strategy:** How should we handle Supabase connection failures during development? Need consistent error boundaries.

4. **TypeScript Strictness:** What level of TypeScript strictness is appropriate? Consider `strict: true` vs. gradual adoption.

5. **Development Workflow:** Should we implement hot reload for database schema changes during development? Consider migration strategy.
