# Release Design Document: v0.4.0-polish
Technical implementation and design guide for the upcoming release.

## 1. Features Summary
_Overview of features included in this release._

This release focuses on polishing the user experience and optimizing performance for production readiness:

- **F015: Performance Optimization** - Implement code splitting, lazy loading, and bundle optimization for faster load times
- **F016: UI/UX Refinements** - Enhance styling, accessibility, and mobile interface with focus on usability improvements
- **F017: Loading States** - Add smooth loading indicators and transitions throughout the application
- **F018: Cross-browser Testing** - Ensure compatibility across iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile, Firefox Mobile, and other browsers
- **F019: Email Duplicate Handling** - Enhance upsert logic with better user feedback for existing attendees

## 2. Technical Architecture Overview
_High-level technical structure that supports all features in this release._

**Performance Architecture:**
- **Code Splitting**: Implement dynamic imports for screen components to reduce initial bundle size
- **Lazy Loading**: Load non-critical components and assets on demand
- **Bundle Analysis**: Optimize dependencies and eliminate unused code
- **Caching Strategy**: Implement proper browser caching for static assets

**UI/UX Enhancement Strategy:**
- **Accessibility Improvements**: Enhanced ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support
- **Visual Polish**: Refined animations, better spacing, improved typography
- **Mobile Optimization**: Enhanced touch targets, improved gesture handling
- **Design System**: Consistent component styling and interaction patterns

**Loading State Management:**
- **Progressive Loading**: Show content as it becomes available
- **Skeleton Screens**: Implement skeleton loading for better perceived performance
- **Transition Animations**: Smooth state changes and screen navigation
- **Error State Handling**: Improved error recovery and user guidance

**Cross-browser Compatibility:**
- **CSS Fallbacks**: Ensure graceful degradation for unsupported features
- **JavaScript Polyfills**: Add necessary polyfills for older browsers
- **Testing Matrix**: Systematic testing across target browser/device combinations
- **Performance Baseline**: Establish performance benchmarks across browsers

## 3. Implementation Notes
_Shared technical considerations across all features in this release._

**Performance Optimization Approach:**
```typescript
// Dynamic imports for code splitting
const WelcomeScreen = lazy(() => import('$lib/screens/WelcomeScreen.svelte'));
const CheckinForm = lazy(() => import('$lib/screens/CheckinForm.svelte'));
const ConfirmationScreen = lazy(() => import('$lib/screens/ConfirmationScreen.svelte'));
```

**Bundle Optimization Strategy:**
- Analyze current bundle size and identify optimization opportunities
- Implement tree shaking for unused library code
- Optimize image assets and implement responsive image loading
- Minify and compress assets for production builds

**Accessibility Enhancement Plan:**
- Audit current accessibility compliance using tools like axe-core
- Implement proper heading hierarchy and landmark roles
- Add keyboard navigation support for all interactive elements
- Ensure color contrast meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- Add focus management for screen readers

**Loading State Implementation:**
- Create reusable Loading component with different variations
- Implement skeleton screens for form elements and content areas
- Add progress indicators for multi-step processes
- Create smooth transitions between loading and loaded states

**Mobile UX Improvements:**
- Optimize touch target sizes (minimum 44px)
- Implement haptic feedback where appropriate
- Improve gesture handling and scroll behavior
- Enhance form input experience on mobile keyboards

## 4. Other Technical Considerations
_Shared any other technical information that might be relevant to building this release._

**Browser Testing Strategy:**
- **Primary Targets**: iOS Safari (latest 2 versions), Chrome Mobile (latest), Firefox Mobile (latest)
- **Secondary Targets**: Samsung Internet, Edge Mobile
- **Testing Tools**: BrowserStack for cross-browser testing, Lighthouse for performance auditing
- **Performance Metrics**: Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS) tracking

**Performance Monitoring:**
- Implement Web Vitals tracking for real user monitoring
- Add performance timing APIs for detailed metrics
- Set up error tracking for production issues
- Create performance budgets and CI checks

**CSS Optimization:**
- Audit and remove unused CSS
- Implement critical CSS inlining for above-the-fold content
- Optimize CSS delivery and reduce render-blocking resources
- Consider CSS-in-JS optimizations for component-scoped styles

**Email Duplicate Handling Enhancement:**
- Improve user messaging when updating existing attendee information
- Add confirmation dialogs for data updates
- Implement optimistic UI updates with rollback capability
- Enhanced validation feedback for duplicate scenarios

**Asset Optimization:**
- Optimize and compress images (use WebP with fallbacks)
- Implement responsive image loading
- Add proper caching headers for static assets
- Consider CDN integration for faster asset delivery

## 5. Open Questions
_Unresolved technical or product questions affecting this release._

1. **Performance Budget**: What are the target performance metrics (load time, bundle size, etc.) we should aim for?

2. **Browser Support**: Should we include polyfills for older browsers, or focus only on modern mobile browsers?

3. **Animation Strategy**: Should we implement custom animations or use a library like Framer Motion for consistency?

4. **Image Optimization**: Do we need responsive images, or are the current assets sufficient for the use case?

5. **Accessibility Level**: Should we target WCAG 2.1 AA or AAA compliance?

6. **Error Tracking**: Should we implement client-side error tracking (Sentry, LogRocket) for production monitoring?

7. **Performance Monitoring**: Do we need real user monitoring (RUM) or are synthetic tests sufficient?

8. **Offline Capability**: Should we add basic offline support or service worker implementation?
