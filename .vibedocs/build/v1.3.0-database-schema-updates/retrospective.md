# Release Retrospective – v1.3.0-database-schema-updates
This document reflects on what worked, what didn't, and how future releases can be improved.

## Release Summary
Successfully completed comprehensive migration from "meetup" to "group" terminology throughout the CheckInto application. This included database schema changes, TypeScript interface updates, component refactoring, and improved asset path resolution using the new `profilename` field. The release also added `bio` field to the talent table and laid groundwork for future favicon support.

## What Went Well
_List things that were successful or effective during this release._

- **Systematic Approach**: Breaking the migration into clear phases (Database → Code → Assets → Testing) made the complex changes manageable
- **Database-First Strategy**: Completing all database changes before touching code prevented conflicts and enabled clean validation
- **Comprehensive Planning**: The design document and tasklist helped track all the moving pieces across 13 tasks
- **Asset Path Improvement**: Switching from hostname detection to `event.group.profilename` eliminated development environment issues and improved reliability
- **No Breaking Changes**: All changes maintained backward compatibility with legacy type aliases
- **Zero Visual Regression**: UI maintained identical appearance while completely changing underlying data structures
- **Additional Improvements**: Opportunistically improved asset path logic and added the bio field during the migration

## What Could Have Gone Better
_List things that caused friction, confusion, or delays._

- **Scope Creep**: The `meetup_host_id` → `group_host_id` change wasn't in original scope and required additional migration script
- **Asset Path Discovery**: The hostname detection issues weren't discovered until testing, requiring mid-stream architecture change
- **Field Constraints**: Database NOT NULL constraints weren't initially specified and had to be clarified during implementation
- **Favicon Implementation**: Initially planned but had to be deferred to future release to control scope

## Lessons Learned
_Both human and AI can add insights here. Focus on what to repeat or avoid in the future._

- **Event Data > Environment Detection**: Using data from the loaded event (profilename) is more reliable than parsing environment (hostname)
- **Database Constraints Matter**: Clarify field nullability requirements upfront to avoid schema inconsistencies
- **Test Early in Multiple Environments**: IP address hostname parsing issues could have been caught earlier with broader testing
- **Migration Scripts Are Cheap**: Creating separate migration scripts for related changes (host field) is better than complex single scripts
- **Documentation During Development**: Updating design.md as implementation evolved kept documentation accurate and useful

## Action Items
_Concrete steps or process changes to carry forward into the next release._

- **Environment Testing**: Include IP address and localhost testing in development workflow
- **Database Schema Review**: Always specify field constraints (NOT NULL, UNIQUE) in initial requirements gathering
- **Asset Path Patterns**: Use entity data over environment parsing for path construction in future features  
- **Scope Management**: Be more explicit about which related changes belong in current vs future releases
- **Migration Validation**: Add verification queries to all migration scripts for easier post-execution validation
