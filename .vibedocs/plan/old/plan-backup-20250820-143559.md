## Overview
_A quick summary of what this plan is for and what product it's implementing._

This plan outlines the implementation strategy for a mobile-first meetup check-in web application. The system enables in-person event attendees to self-register through event-specific URLs with a simple three-screen flow: Welcome → Check-in Form → Confirmation. The application will capture attendee information and provide venue details post-check-in.

## Architecture
_High-level structure and major technical decisions. Include how the system is organized (e.g., client-server, monolith, microservices) and the proposed tech stack (frameworks, languages, storage, deployment)._

**Architecture Pattern:** JAMstack (JavaScript, APIs, Markup) with client-server separation
**Frontend:** SvelteKit SPA with static site generation for optimal performance
**Backend:** Supabase providing database, API, and real-time capabilities
**Deployment:** Netlify for frontend hosting with automatic Git deployments
**Domain:** Custom domain routing through Netlify (meetup.icodewith.ai)

This architecture provides a lightweight, scalable solution with minimal server management overhead while ensuring fast load times and reliable performance.

## Components
_What are the key parts/modules of the system and what do they do?_

- **Welcome Screen Component:** Displays event title and welcome message with prominent check-in button
- **Check-in Form Component:** Collects attendee information (name, email, interesting fact) with validation
- **Confirmation Screen Component:** Shows success message and venue information post-check-in
- **Event Router:** Handles URL parsing to identify event ID and route to appropriate screens
- **Database Service:** Manages Supabase API calls for data persistence and retrieval
- **Validation Module:** Handles form validation and email format checking
- **Error Handling System:** Manages inactive events, network errors, and validation failures

## Data Model
_What are the main types of data or objects the system will manage?_

- **Event Object:** ID, URL_ID, Title, Welcome Message, Checked In Message, Active status
- **Attendee Object:** ID, First Name, Last Name, Email (unique), Interesting Fact, timestamps
- **Event_Attendee Relationship:** Junction table linking Events to Attendees for many-to-many relationships
- **Application State:** Current event data, form input state, loading states, error messages

## Major Technical Steps
_What are the major technical steps required to implement this product? Keep the tasks high-level and milestone-focused (e.g., "Build user input form," not "Write handleInput() function"). These will guide the AGENT or dev team in breaking down the work further._

- **Project Setup:** Initialize SvelteKit project with TypeScript and configure development environment
- **Database Setup:** Create Supabase project and implement database schema with tables and relationships
- **Routing Implementation:** Build dynamic routing for event-specific URLs and navigation flow
- **UI Components Development:** Create responsive components for all three screens with mobile-first design
- **Form Handling System:** Implement form validation, submission, and error handling
- **Database Integration:** Connect frontend to Supabase API with proper error handling and rate limiting
- **Event Management Logic:** Implement active/inactive event handling and appropriate user messaging
- **Testing & Validation:** Test user flows, form validation, and mobile responsiveness
- **Deployment Setup:** Configure Netlify deployment with custom domain and environment variables
- **Performance Optimization:** Implement code splitting, lazy loading, and optimize for mobile performance

## Tools & Services
_What tools, APIs, or libraries will be used?_

- **SvelteKit:** Frontend framework with SSR/SSG capabilities
- **TypeScript:** Type safety and improved developer experience
- **Supabase:** Database, API, and backend services
- **Supabase JavaScript Client:** Official client library for database operations
- **Netlify:** Hosting, deployment, and domain management
- **Tailwind CSS:** Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development
- **Vite:** Build tool and development server (included with SvelteKit)
- **ESLint/Prettier:** Code linting and formatting
- **Git/GitHub:** Version control and repository hosting

## Risks & Unknowns
_What might block us, or what needs more investigation?_

- **Supabase Rate Limits:** Need to understand free tier limitations and potential upgrade requirements
- **Mobile Browser Compatibility:** Ensure consistent behavior across different mobile browsers and devices
- **Domain Configuration:** Setting up custom domain routing through Netlify may require DNS configuration
- **Form Validation Edge Cases:** Handling various email formats and special characters in names/facts
- **Event URL Collision:** Risk of URL_ID conflicts if not properly managed
- **Performance Under Load:** Unknown behavior during high-traffic events (multiple simultaneous check-ins)
- **Data Privacy Compliance:** Ensure email collection meets privacy requirements and user expectations

## Milestones
_What are the major implementation phases or delivery checkpoints?_

- **Milestone 1 - Foundation (Week 1):** Project setup, database schema, basic routing
- **Milestone 2 - Core Functionality (Week 2):** All three screens working with basic styling
- **Milestone 3 - Integration (Week 3):** Database integration, form validation, error handling
- **Milestone 4 - Polish (Week 4):** Mobile optimization, final styling, performance tuning
- **Milestone 5 - Deployment (Week 5):** Production deployment, domain configuration, testing

## Environment Setup
_What setup steps are needed to start development or run the app?_

- **Node.js Installation:** Ensure Node.js 18+ is installed for SvelteKit development
- **Supabase Project Setup:** Create Supabase account and new project, obtain API keys
- **Git Repository:** Initialize repository and connect to GitHub for version control
- **SvelteKit Project Initialization:** Create new SvelteKit project with TypeScript template
- **Environment Variables:** Configure local .env file with Supabase URL and API keys
- **Development Dependencies:** Install and configure Tailwind CSS, ESLint, Prettier
- **Database Schema:** Run SQL scripts to create tables and relationships in Supabase
- **Local Development Server:** Start development server and verify basic functionality
