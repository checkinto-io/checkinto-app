## **Technical Implementation Notes**

### Database Schema Details
- **event_attendee table additions:**
  - `raffle_winner` BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
  - `raffle_round` INTEGER NULL
- **meetup table additions:**
  - `raffle_winners_to_display` INTEGER DEFAULT 1
- **Composite Index:** `CREATE INDEX idx_raffle_lookup ON event_attendee(event_id, raffle_winner, raffle_round)`

### Query Chain Architecture
```
ConfirmationScreen â†’ event_attendee â†’ attendee â†’ event â†’ meetup
```

### Polling Strategy
- 5-second intervals using setInterval
- Automatic cleanup on component unmount
- Optimized queries to reduce database load

### Winner Selection Algorithm
- Random selection from eligible attendees
- Exclude existing winners from current and previous rounds
- Transaction-based updates for race condition protection

### Error Handling Requirements
- Network failure recovery
- Database transaction rollback
- User-friendly error messages
- Automatic retry mechanisms
