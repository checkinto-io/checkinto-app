# Release Design Document : - **v1.0.0-deployment**
Technical implementation and design guide for the upcoming release.

## 1. Features Summary
_Overview of features included in this release._

This release focuses on production deployment of the meetup check-in application to Vercel with custom domain configuration. The application is fully functional with all core features completed through v0.8.0-raffle-system, including:

- Complete three-screen user flow (Welcome → Check-in → Confirmation)
- Real-time raffle winner announcement system
- Mobile-responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Supabase backend integration with normalized database schema
- Persistent state management for confirmation screens

**Key Deployment Features:**
- **F020: Vercel Deployment** - Configure production hosting with Vercel
- **F021: Custom Domain Setup** - Configure meetup.icodewith.ai domain
- **F022: Environment Variables** - Production environment configuration
- **F023: Production Testing** - End-to-end testing in production
- **F024: Documentation** - User and deployment documentation

## 2. Technical Architecture Overview
_High-level technical structure that supports all features in this release._

**Current Architecture:**
- **Frontend:** SvelteKit SPA with static site generation
- **Backend:** Supabase (database, API, Edge Functions)
- **Current State:** Local development environment only

**Target Production Architecture:**
- **Hosting Platform:** Vercel (replacing originally planned Netlify)
- **Domain:** meetup.icodewith.ai with custom domain configuration
- **Database:** Supabase (already configured and operational)
- **Edge Functions:** Supabase Edge Functions (for raffle system)
- **Build Process:** Vercel's automatic Git deployments
- **Environment Management:** Vercel environment variables

**Integration Points:**
- Vercel ↔ GitHub repository for automatic deployments
- Vercel ↔ Supabase for database connectivity
- Custom domain DNS ↔ Vercel for domain routing
- Supabase Edge Functions ↔ Production environment variables

## 3. Implementation Notes
_Shared technical considerations across all features in this release._

**Vercel-Specific Considerations:**
- SvelteKit has native Vercel adapter support via `@sveltejs/adapter-vercel`
- Vercel automatically handles SvelteKit SSR/SSG optimization
- Environment variables must be configured in Vercel dashboard
- Custom domains require DNS configuration pointing to Vercel

**Environment Variables Required:**
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` - Supabase project URL
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Supabase anonymous key
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` - For Edge Functions (if needed)

**Build Configuration:**
- Ensure `package.json` includes proper build scripts
- Verify `svelte.config.js` is configured for Vercel adapter
- Check that all dependencies are properly declared

**Domain Configuration:**
- Configure DNS records for meetup.icodewith.ai through Namecheap.com
- Set up SSL certificates (automatic with Vercel)
- Verify domain routing and redirects

## 4. Other Technical Considerations
_Shared any other technical information that might be relevant to building this release._

**Performance Optimization:**
- Vercel provides automatic edge caching and CDN
- SvelteKit's code splitting and lazy loading already implemented
- Static asset optimization handled by Vercel

**Security Considerations:**
- Environment variables properly secured in Vercel
- Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) already implemented
- HTTPS automatically enforced by Vercel

**Monitoring and Analytics:**
- Vercel provides built-in analytics and performance monitoring
- Consider adding error tracking for production environment
- Monitor Supabase usage and performance metrics

**Backup and Recovery:**
- Database backups handled by Supabase
- Code versioning through Git/GitHub
- Vercel deployment history for rollback capabilities

## 5. Open Questions
_Unresolved technical or product questions affecting this release._

1. **DNS Configuration:** Domain is managed through Namecheap.com. Need to configure DNS records to point to Vercel.

> Correct!

2. **Domain Verification:** Does the user have access to configure DNS records for the icodewith.ai domain?

> I do!

3. **Supabase Environment:** Are there separate Supabase projects for development and production, or will we use the same project?

> Same project. I should do separate them, but in the future.

4. **Vercel Plan:** What Vercel plan is being used? This affects custom domain capabilities and build limits.

> Hobby for now.  Will consider Pro in the future.

5. **SSL Certificate:** Any specific SSL certificate requirements or will Vercel's automatic SSL suffice?

> Their auto SSL is ok for now.

6. **Error Monitoring:** Should we implement additional error monitoring tools (Sentry, LogRocket, etc.) for production?

> Not now.

7. **Performance Budget:** Are there specific performance requirements or budgets for the production deployment?

> No.

8. **Deployment Strategy:** Blue-green deployment, rolling updates, or simple replacement deployment preferred?

> The simpler the better.  So you pick the simplest deployment path.  This is a very small app for a very small group of people.
