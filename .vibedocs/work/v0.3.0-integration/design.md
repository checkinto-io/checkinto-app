# Release Design Document: v0.3.0-integration
Technical implementation and design guide for the upcoming release.

## 1. Features Summary
_Overview of features included in this release._

This release focuses on connecting the frontend UI to the Supabase backend and implementing complete data persistence with robust error handling:

- **F010: Supabase Integration** - Connect app to Supabase API with proper authentication and client setup
- **F011: Form Validation** - Enhanced client-side and server-side validation with real-time feedback
- **F012: Data Persistence** - Save attendee check-ins to database with upsert logic for duplicate emails
- **F013: Error Handling** - Handle inactive events, network errors, validation failures, and API timeouts
- **F014: Event Status Logic** - Implement active/inactive event management with proper user messaging

## 2. Technical Architecture Overview
_High-level technical structure that supports all features in this release._

**Backend Integration:**
- Supabase JavaScript client library for database operations
- Real-time API calls for event data retrieval and attendee persistence
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies for data access control
- Environment variable management for API keys and URLs

**Database Operations:**
- **Events Table**: Query by URL_ID to load event data and check active status
- **Attendees Table**: Upsert operations using email as unique identifier
- **Event_Attendees Junction**: Create relationships between events and attendees
- **Error Recovery**: Retry logic for failed database operations

**Validation Strategy:**
- **Client-side**: Immediate feedback using Svelte reactive statements
- **Server-side**: Database constraints and validation before persistence
- **Email Uniqueness**: Handle duplicate email scenarios with upsert logic
- **Data Integrity**: Ensure all required fields are present and valid

**Error Handling Architecture:**
```
API Call → Success → Continue Flow
    ↓
  Failure → Categorize Error → Display User Message
    ↓
Network/Timeout → Retry Logic → Show Retry Option
Database Error → Log & Show Generic Message
Validation Error → Show Specific Field Errors
```

## 3. Implementation Notes
_Shared technical considerations across all features in this release._

**Supabase Client Setup:**
- Initialize client in `src/lib/supabase.ts` with environment variables
- Use TypeScript interfaces for database schema type safety
- Implement connection error handling and fallback messaging

**Database Schema Integration:**
```typescript
interface Event {
  id: string;
  url_id: string;
  title: string;
  welcome_message: string;
  checked_in_message: string;
  active: boolean;
  created_at: string;
}

interface Attendee {
  id: string;
  first_name: string;
  last_name: string;
  email: string;
  interesting_fact: string;
  created_at: string;
  updated_at: string;
}
```

**Form Validation Implementation:**
- Zod schema validation for type safety and consistent validation rules
- Real-time validation feedback with debounced API calls
- Progressive validation (validate as user types, not on every keystroke)
- Custom validation messages for better UX

**Error State Management:**
- Centralized error handling with user-friendly messages
- Loading states during API operations
- Graceful degradation when backend is unavailable
- Retry mechanisms for transient failures

## 4. Other Technical Considerations
_Shared any other technical information that might be relevant to building this release._

**Performance Optimizations:**
- Debounced validation to reduce API calls
- Cached event data to minimize database queries
- Optimistic UI updates with rollback on failure
- Connection pooling and efficient query patterns

**Security Considerations:**
- Input sanitization for all user-provided data
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries
- Rate limiting to prevent spam submissions
- Secure environment variable handling

**User Experience Enhancements:**
- Loading spinners during database operations
- Clear error messages with actionable guidance
- Offline detection and appropriate messaging
- Form state persistence during network issues

**Testing Strategy:**
- Unit tests for validation functions
- Integration tests for database operations
- Error scenario testing (network failures, invalid data)
- Cross-browser compatibility testing

## 5. Open Questions
_Unresolved technical or product questions affecting this release._

1. **Retry Logic**: How many retry attempts should we make for failed database operations before showing permanent error?

2. **Offline Handling**: Should we implement offline form storage with sync when connection is restored, or just show error messages?

3. **Rate Limiting**: What are appropriate rate limits for form submissions to prevent abuse while allowing legitimate use?

4. **Error Logging**: Should we implement client-side error logging to help debug issues in production?

5. **Validation Timing**: Should email uniqueness validation happen on blur, on submit, or in real-time as user types?

6. **Event Caching**: How long should we cache event data before re-fetching from database?

7. **Database Timeouts**: What timeout values should we use for database operations to balance responsiveness with reliability?
