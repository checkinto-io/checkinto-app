# Release Design Document - v0.6.0-add-state-to-checked-in-page
Technical implementation and design guide for adding persistent state to the checked-in confirmation page.

## 1. Features Summary
_Overview of features included in this release._

### Persistent Confirmation State
- **State Persistence**: Once users reach the confirmation/checked-in page, this state persists indefinitely across browser sessions
- **Browser Refresh Resilience**: Page refreshes maintain the confirmation state instead of resetting to welcome screen
- **Session Continuity**: Closing and reopening the browser preserves the confirmed state
- **Controlled Reset**: Only the "Check In Another Person" button can clear the persistent state

### Enhanced User Experience
- **Seamless Recovery**: Users who accidentally refresh or close their browser won't lose their progress
- **Intentional Navigation**: Clear path forward with deliberate action required to start new check-in process
- **State Integrity**: Confirmation state is tied to specific events to prevent cross-contamination

## 2. Technical Architecture Overview
_High-level technical structure that supports all features in this release._

### Frontend State Management
- **Svelte Stores**: Enhanced navigation store with localStorage integration
- **Browser Storage**: localStorage for persistent state across sessions
- **Event-Scoped Storage**: Keys include event ID to isolate states per event

### Storage Strategy
- **Storage Key Pattern**: `meetup-checkin-${eventId}-confirmation-state`
- **Data Structure**: JSON object containing confirmation status and timestamp
- **Browser Compatibility**: localStorage is supported across all modern browsers

### Navigation Flow Enhancement
- **Initialization Check**: On page load, check localStorage for existing confirmation state
- **State Restoration**: If confirmed state exists, navigate directly to confirmation screen
- **State Clearing**: "Check In Another Person" button removes localStorage entry

## 3. Implementation Notes
_Shared technical considerations across all features in this release._

### localStorage Integration
```typescript
interface ConfirmationState {
  isConfirmed: boolean;
  timestamp: number;
  eventId: string;
}
```

### Key Implementation Areas
1. **Navigation Store Enhancement**
   - Add localStorage read/write methods
   - Modify initialization logic to check for stored state
   - Update reset methods to clear localStorage

2. **Page Load Logic**
   - Check for stored confirmation state on mount
   - Navigate to confirmation screen if state exists
   - Maintain existing navigation for non-confirmed states
   - **Clear stored state if event is inactive or not found**

3. **Button Action Updates**
   - Modify "Check In Another Person" to clear stored state
   - Ensure form reset functionality remains intact

4. **Event State Validation**
   - Clear localStorage if event becomes inactive (`active: false`)
   - Handle event not found scenarios by clearing stored state
   - Ensure stale confirmation states don't persist for invalid events

### Browser Storage Management
- **Storage Cleanup**: Consider implementing expiration logic (future enhancement)
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback if localStorage is unavailable
- **Privacy Considerations**: No sensitive user data stored, only confirmation status

## 4. Other Technical Considerations
_Shared any other technical information that might be relevant to building this release._

### Security & Privacy
- **Data Minimization**: Only store confirmation status, no personal information
- **Event Isolation**: Each event has separate storage key to prevent conflicts
- **Client-Side Only**: No server-side session management required

### Performance Impact
- **Minimal Overhead**: Single localStorage read on page initialization
- **No Network Calls**: Purely client-side state management
- **Fast State Recovery**: Immediate navigation to confirmation screen

### Testing Considerations
- **Browser Refresh Testing**: Verify state persists through multiple refreshes
- **Cross-Tab Behavior**: Test behavior with multiple browser tabs/windows
- **Storage Edge Cases**: Handle localStorage quota exceeded or disabled scenarios
- **Event State Changes**: Test that stored confirmation is cleared when event becomes inactive
- **Invalid Event URLs**: Verify localStorage cleanup when accessing deactivated events

### Future Enhancements (Out of Scope)
- **State Expiration**: Auto-clear confirmation after X hours/days
- **Multiple Attendee Support**: Track confirmation for different email addresses
- **Analytics Integration**: Track confirmation persistence patterns

## 5. Open Questions
_Unresolved technical or product questions affecting this release._

### Resolved Questions
1. **Q: Should confirmation state expire automatically?**
   A: No, state should persist indefinitely until manually cleared via "Check In Another Person"

2. **Q: How should we handle multiple events in the same browser?**
   A: Use event-scoped localStorage keys to isolate states per event

3. **Q: What happens if localStorage is disabled?**
   A: Application falls back to current behavior (state resets on refresh)

### No Outstanding Questions
All technical and product requirements have been clarified and documented above.
