# Release Retrospective – v0.1.0-foundation
This document reflects on what worked, what didn't, and how future releases can be improved.

## Release Summary

Successfully completed the foundation release for the meetup check-in application. This release established:
- Complete project infrastructure with SvelteKit + TypeScript
- Full database schema with Supabase (3 tables with relationships)
- Dynamic routing system for event-specific URLs
- Comprehensive type safety and validation system
- Working welcome screen with mobile-responsive design
- Development environment with linting and code quality tools

All 30 tasks across 6 phases were completed successfully with zero build errors and clean code quality checks.

## What Went Well

- **Systematic Approach:** The 6-phase structure (Project Init → Dev Environment → Database → Routing → TypeScript → Testing) worked extremely well
- **TypeScript Integration:** Comprehensive type system prevented errors and provided excellent developer experience
- **Database Design:** Clean 3-table schema with proper relationships and security policies
- **Code Quality:** ESLint and Prettier setup ensured consistent, high-quality code
- **Mobile-First Design:** Beautiful, responsive UI that works perfectly on mobile devices
- **Git Workflow:** Regular commits after each phase provided good backup points
- **Supabase Integration:** Smooth setup with working database queries and proper environment variable handling
- **User Testing:** URL convention change (082025 format) shows good flexibility and user feedback integration

## What Could Have Gone Better

- **Package.json Management:** Supabase dependency was initially missed during Phase 2, causing issues in Phase 4
- **Type Conflicts:** Initial Event type naming conflict with DOM Event required renaming to MeetupEvent
- **Bash Environment:** Had intermittent issues with bash commands that required user intervention
- **ESLint Cleanup:** Had a few unused import warnings that needed final cleanup

## Lessons Learned

- **Dependencies First:** Always ensure all package.json dependencies are properly added and installed before moving to implementation phases
- **Type Naming:** Avoid naming conflicts with built-in browser APIs (Event, Element, etc.) by using descriptive prefixes
- **Incremental Testing:** Regular testing after each phase caught issues early and prevented compound problems
- **User Feedback Integration:** Flexible enough to accommodate user preferences (URL naming convention change)
- **Vibedocs Workflow:** The structured approach with discovery → PRD → plan → work phases provided excellent organization

## Action Items

- **For Next Release:** Consider adding form validation and check-in functionality (the actual check-in form and confirmation screens)
- **Deployment Preparation:** Add Netlify adapter configuration for production deployment
- **Environment Setup:** Document any bash/environment setup requirements for future developers
- **Testing Strategy:** Consider adding unit tests for database service functions
- **UI Enhancement:** Build out the remaining screens (check-in form, confirmation page) with the same quality standards
